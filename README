TO RUN THE TABLESTUCK BOT, YOU FIRST NEED TO FOLLOW THESE STEPS --
[FOR WINDOWS]
1- Download and install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org)
  When the Node.js installation asks if you want to install tools necessary to compile native modules, please make sure that the box is checked!
  If you don't do this, you will need to install python and Visual Studio c++ manually.

2- Download or make a clone of this repository
  cloning the repository makes it eaiser to update the bot as we change it, but simply downloading the files lets you run it without setting up git.

3- Edit the auth-template.json file
  the auth.json file will be created when you first run your bot, and requires your bot token and chosen prefix for commands before running properly.

  The bot has a TOURNAMENT MODE. If client.limit in bot.js is 0, it is disabled, but if it is a number greater than 0, it is enabled.
  If the bot is in TOURNAMENT MODE, auth.json will need an extra section called "list" with a list of discord IDs allowed in your tournament:
  {
    "token": "YOUR DISCORD BOT TOKEN HERE",
    "prefix": ">",
    "admin": "YOUR DISCORD ID HERE",
    "list": [
        "DISCORD ID",
        "DISCORD ID"
    ]
  }
4- Open the command terminal on your computer in the bot's folder and type the following --
  npm install discord.js
  npm install enmap
  npm install canvas
  This should create a folder called node_modules/ and files called package.json (which is only created on linux, warnings of it not being there are fine) and package-lock.json
  After that, the folder should be something like this --
  ->Bot folder/
    ->data/
    ->node_modules/
    ->This repository as a folder/
      ->bot.js, other folders and files...
    ->auth.json
    ->package.json
    ->package-lock.json

7- Run the file "run.bat" (or "run.sh" on linux or mac) to start the bot
  If you have nodemon or forever installed, you can use runrepeat.bat (runrepeat.sh) or runforever.bat (runforever.sh) to run the bot with those

--this code is not the finished version of the bot and will continue to be updated regularly on github--
